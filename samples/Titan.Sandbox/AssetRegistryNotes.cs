     * Put all manifests into the same file/class. Cleaner than adding more generated files
     * Group things better than it's done toda√Ω. I think everyhing is placed under Textures
     * Create a #debug only disctionary with ManifestId+AssetId as the key. This is for hot reload support and debugging.
     * Rewrite the entire Packager into something that can be extended (and supports trimming, trimming currently breaks it because of Json)
